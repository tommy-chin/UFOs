# UFOs
## Purpose
A client by the name of Dana was interested in creating a webpage with a dynamic table that would give insight into UFO sightings around the United States. Originally, Dana had requested that a filter option be added so that users could filter the table by the date of the UFO sightings. It was then requested that filters be added for not only the date but also the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The webpage created is able to apply any number of these filters at once. 
## Results
To perform a filtered search on the table, the user would need to access the filter search section of the webpage as seen in Image 1. The user would then need to type in whichever criteras they were interested in to the respective filter boxes and press the enter key on their keyboard. As seen in Image 2, two criteras were entered in. The 1st being the date of "1/10/2010" and the 2nd being the shape of "sphere". The table would then be updated to reflect the filtered search. It is important that the user enters all of the searches in lowercase letters and that the date is entered in mm/dd/yyyy format with single digit months not having a zero in front.

## Summary
As mentioned in the results, the webpage does have a small flaw in regards to the filter search. The filter search is rather specific in what the user enters in that the filter search is case sensitive and the date only accepts mm/dd/yyyy format. Any searches done that are not within these parameters will lead to the table not populating with the search that the user had in mind. The reason why this happens is because the filter search looks for exact matches with the user entry and the data.js file. One simple recommendation for further development would be to include detailed instructions on how to properly use filter search by embedding a new section in the html specifically for instructions. Another recommendation would be to change the app.js so that the filter accounts for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
