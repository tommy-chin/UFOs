# UFOs
## Purpose
A client by the name of Dana was interested in creating a webpage with a dynamic table that would give insight into UFO sightings around the United States. Originally, Dana had requested that a filter option be added so that users could filter the table by the date of the UFO sightings. It was then requested that filters be added for not only the date but also the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The webpage created is able to apply any number of these filters at once. 
## Results
To perform a filtered search on the table, the user would need to access the filter search section of the webpage as seen in Image 1. The user would then need to type in whichever criteras they were interested in to the respective filter boxes and press the enter key on their keyboard. As seen in Image 2, two criteras were entered in. The 1st being the date of "1/10/2010" and the 2nd being the shape of "sphere".
